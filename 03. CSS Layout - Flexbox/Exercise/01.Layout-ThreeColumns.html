        <h1>Three laws of robotics</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system for humans and robots.</p>
        <div class="laws">
            <div class="law">
                <h2>1st Law</h2>
                <p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</p>
            </div>
            <div class="law">
                <h2>2nd Law</h2>
                <p>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law</p>
            </div>
            <div class="law">
                <h2>3rd Law</h2>
                <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="note">Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated that “<em>a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.</em>”</p>
